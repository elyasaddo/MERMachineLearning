The nodes at each layer correspond to some combination of the musical features used in the emotion evaluation. The outputs of the nodes are the weightings of those particular combinations for the next layer's usage. The value (or activity) of the node itself is calculated by summing up all of the incoming weights. Since the activities need to be some what normalised, this sum is then put through a function (Sigmoid function) which ensures that the final activity level is between 0 and 1. Of course the summing step does not apply to the very first layer, as the first layer has only the extracted musical features as direct inputs. When the network is initialised, the weight between input units and hidden layers and between hidden layers and outputs were set to random numbers close to zero.

In the training stages after a run<!--right word?--> of the neural network, the error between the desired outputs and the calculated outputs, the weightings are then adjusted and the network is run again.
